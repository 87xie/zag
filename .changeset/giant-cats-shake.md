BREAKING ðŸ’¥: Refactor connect function in favor of uniform APIs across frameworks

Due to the fact that we tried to make "React" the baseline, there was a lot of inherent complexity in how we managed
types in the codebase.

We've now removed the `PropTypes` export in favor of passing `normalizeProps` in the `api.connect` function. This is now
required for React as well.

You can remove the `<PropTypes>` generic and Zag will auto-infer the types from `normalizeProps`.

**For Vue and Solid**

```diff
-api.connect<PropTypes>(state, send, normalizeProps)
+api.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
```

**For React**

```diff
-api.connect(state, send)
+api.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
```
